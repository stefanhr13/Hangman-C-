# Hangman-C-
## A 1 or 2 player hangman game written in C++
I am a beginner to C++ and programming so I am sure there are plenty of ways this code can be improved and streamlined and any tips are more than welcome.
Otherwise feel free to run this console application wherever and edit/do anything you like with it.
Enjoy!
